## introduction
The subject of the work is the simulation of a WiFi signal using the finite difference method. The non-homogeneous Helmholtz equation was employed for this purpose, and its solution is equivalent to finding the values of the electromagnetic field intensity. The methods applied are transparent and, at the same time, accurate. I hope that the following reading will allow the reader to easily replicate the calculations, adjusting only certain elements to individual needs.
